	<h1>Affordable Single Rooms in Machakos</h1>
	<p>Hello my Fellow students, i am from kenya in africa. in kenya i live in a place called Machakos and i live
	in a single room. 
	
	I noticed when a person are moving to a new house, lets say i live in a room called wati, and i would like to 
	move to another one, i noticed that people take a  lot of time trying to identify a new room. 
	like you have to walk around the town asking if there is a vacant room. so idecided let me come up with a 
	webpage whereby users will find different houses there and they can choose the one that suits them the best 
	
	</p>
	
	<h2>The Title of my page is:Affordable Single Rooms in Machakos</h2>
	
	<h3>I chose that title because </h3>
	
	<p>1. it includes the main keys words which are, Single rooms,Affordable and Machakos<p>
	<p>2. The title is shorter than 60 characters some of its worlds will nt be cut  off in SEARCH ENGINE RESULTS PAGE<p>
	<p>3. key word affordable might triger a user to click that page since people are always looking for items that are within 
		their budget. <p>

	time for studying, whatsapp me in that Number and i can learn it on your behalf at a cost friendly price</p>
